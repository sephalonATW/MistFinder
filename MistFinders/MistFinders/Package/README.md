## Description
This mod creates two new consumable items which assist you in finding things in the Mistlands. To use them, either right-click them in your inventory, or have them equipped on your hotbar and select that number.

Mine Finder: Requires Cauldron level 5, 1 Seeker Trophy, and 10 Seeker Meats. When consumed it will add pins to your map for the nearby Infested Mines

Skull Finder: Requires Cauldron level 5, 1 Bile Bag, and 5 Blood Clots. When consumed it will add pins to your map for the nearby Jotunn Skulls.

## Configuration
The config file has only two values, which are fairly self-explanatory.

MineDetectionRadius: The Mine Finder will find all Infested Mines within this radius (in meters).

SkullDetectionRadius: The Skull Finder will find all Jotunn Skulls within this radius (in meters).

When playing on a server, the config values on the server will be what are used, and the local config will be ignored.
